# Module_4_Topic_1_Validation_with_Try_Assignment
 You can now update your average test scores code from a previous assignment with added input validation using try/except. Details:      Update your previous assignment code to include try/except for each of the user inputs.     If the user enters negative numbers or a string for their number inputs, the except path should print an error message.
